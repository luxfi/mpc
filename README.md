Lux MPC is a high-performance, open-source Multi-Party Computation (MPC) engine for securely generating and managing cryptographic wallets across distributed nodes‚Äîwithout ever exposing the full private key.

At its cryptographic core, Lux MPC integrates Lux TSS, a production-grade threshold signature scheme library developed by Lux. It supports:

- **ECDSA (secp256k1)**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, and EVM-compatible L2 chains

- **EdDSA (Ed25519)**: for Solana, Polkadot, Cardano, and other modern blockchains

## Threshold & Nodes

Lux MPC uses a **t-of-n threshold scheme** to securely generate and sign with private keys.

- `n` = total number of MPC nodes (key shares)
- `t` = minimum number of nodes required to sign

Only `t` out of `n` nodes need to participate ‚Äî the full private key is never reconstructed.

To maintain security against compromised nodes, Lux MPC enforces:

```
t ‚â• ‚åän / 2‚åã + 1
```

### Example: 2-of-3 Threshold

- ‚úÖ `node0 + node1` ‚Üí signs successfully
- ‚úÖ `node1 + node2` ‚Üí signs successfully
- ‚ùå `node0` alone ‚Üí not enough shares

This ensures:

- No single point of compromise
- Fault tolerance if some nodes go offline
- Configurable security by adjusting `t` and `n`

## Architecture

### Overview

Each Lux MPC node:

- Holds a **key share** in local AES-256 encrypted storage (via Badger KV)
- Participates in **threshold signing** using `threshold`
- Communicates over a **resilient messaging layer** using NATS
- Registers itself with **Consul** for service discovery and health checks
- Verifies incoming messages using **Ed25519-based mutual authentication**

### Message Flow & Signature Verification

1. A signing request is broadcast to the MPC cluster through **NATS** as an authenticated event. Each node **verifies the sender's Ed25519 signature** before processing the request.
2. NATS broadcasts the request to the MPC nodes.
3. Each participating node verifies:
   - The **signature** of the sender (Ed25519)
   - The **authenticity** of the message (non-replayable, unique session)
4. If the node is healthy and within the quorum (`t`), it:
   - Computes a partial signature using its share
   - Publishes the result back via NATS
5. Once `t` partial signatures are received, they are aggregated into a full signature.

---

### Properties

- **No single point of compromise**: Keys are never fully assembled
- **Byzantine-resilient**: Only `t` of `n` nodes are required to proceed
- **Scalable and pluggable**: Easily expand the cluster or integrate additional tools
- **Secure peer authentication**: All inter-node messages are signed and verified using Ed25519

## Configuration

The application uses a YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`) with the following key settings:

### Database Configuration

- `badger_password`: Password for encrypting the BadgerDB database
- `db_path`: Path where the database files are stored

### Backup Configuration

- `backup_enabled`: Enable/disable automatic backups (default: true)
- `backup_period_seconds`: How often to perform backups in seconds (default: 300)
- `backup_dir`: Directory where encrypted backups are stored

### Network Configuration

- `nats.url`: NATS server URL
- `consul.address`: Consul server address

### MPC Configuration

- `mpc_threshold`: Threshold for multi-party computation
- `event_initiator_pubkey`: Public key of the event initiator
- `max_concurrent_keygen`: Maximum concurrent key generation operations

		logger.Fatal("Failed to connect to NATS", err)
	}
	defer natsConn.Close()
	mpcClient := client.NewMPCClient(client.Options{
		NatsConn: natsConn,
		KeyPath:  "./event_initiator.key",
	})
	err = mpcClient.OnWalletCreationResult(func(event event.KeygenSuccessEvent) {
		logger.Info("Received wallet creation result", "event", event)
	})
	if err != nil {
		logger.Fatal("Failed to subscribe to wallet-creation results", err)
	}

	walletID := uuid.New().String()
	if err := mpcClient.CreateWallet(walletID); err != nil {
		logger.Fatal("CreateWallet failed", err)
	}
	logger.Info("CreateWallet sent, awaiting result...", "walletID", walletID)
}
```

### Testing

## 1. Unit tests

```
go test ./... -v
```

## 2. Integration tests

cd e2e
make test
```

## Bridge Integration

Lux MPC provides a compatibility layer for seamless integration with the Lux Bridge, allowing migration from the Rust-based MPC implementation to this Go-based solution.

### Bridge Compatibility Features

- **Drop-in Replacement**: Compatible HTTP API on port 6000
- **Protocol Translation**: Converts between KZen (Rust) and threshold (Go) formats
- **Parallel Operation**: Run alongside existing Rust nodes during migration
- **Key Migration**: Tools to convert existing key shares

### Quick Migration

```bash
# Deploy bridge-compatible MPC cluster
cd deployments/bridge
./migrate.sh

# Update bridge configuration
# In mpc.ts, change endpoints to:
# "http://bridge-compat-0:6000"
# "http://bridge-compat-1:6000"
# "http://bridge-compat-2:6000"
```

For detailed bridge integration instructions, see [deployments/bridge/README.md](deployments/bridge/README.md).
